                    <p>
                        Please review these Terms carefully as they serve as an enforceable contract between us and contain important information about your legal rights, remedies, and obligations.

                        IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES OR CANADA, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES WITH 6Figure Earner IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT OR THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION ONLY, AND YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTIONS AND TO HAVE CLAIMS DECIDED BY A JURY, AS EXPLAINED IN THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION SECTION.

                        6Figures’s mission is to improve lives through learning. We enable anyone anywhere to access that educational content to learn (students). We consider our marketplace model the best way to offer valuable educational content to our users. We need rules to keep our platform and services safe for you, us, and our student community. These Terms apply to all your activities on the 6Figure website, the 6Figure mobile applications, our TV applications, our APIs, and other related services (“Services”).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our website and apps cause communications about your browsing and app activities and app usage to be sent from you to third parties who provide services to 6Figure. By using our Services, you consent to these communications.

                    <h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
                    <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure</p>
 
                    <p>At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat.</p>

                    <p>t is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
                    <h3>Accounts</h3>
                    <p>You need an account for most activities on our platform, including to purchase and access content or to submit content for publication. When setting up and maintaining your account, you must provide and continue to provide accurate and complete information, including a valid email address. You have complete responsibility for your account and everything that happens on your account, including for any harm or damage (to us or anyone else) caused by someone using your account without your permission. This means you need to be careful with your password. You may not transfer your account to someone else or use someone else’s account. If you contact us to request access to an account, we will not grant you such access unless you can provide us with the information that we need to prove you are the owner of that account. In the event of the death of a user, the account of that user will be closed.</p>
                    <p>You may not share your account login credentials with anyone else. You are responsible for what happens with your account and 6Figure will not intervene in disputes between students or instructors who have shared account login credentials. You must notify us immediately upon learning that someone else may be using your account without your permission (or if you suspect any other breach of security) by contacting our Support Team. We may request some information from you to confirm that you are indeed the owner of your account.</p>
                    <p>Students and instructors must be at least 18 years of age to create an account on 6Figure and use the Services. If you are younger than 18 but above the required age for consent to use online services where you live (for example, 13 in the US or 16 in Ireland), you may not set up an account, but we encourage you to invite a parent or guardian to open an account and help you access content that is appropriate for you. If you are below this age of consent to use online services, you may not create a 6Figure account. If we discover that you have created an account that violates these rules, we will terminate your account. Under our Instructor Terms, you may be requested to verify your identity before you are authorized to submit content for publication on 6Figure.</p>
                    <p>You can terminate your account at any time by following the steps here. Check our Privacy Policy to see what happens when you terminate your account.</p>
